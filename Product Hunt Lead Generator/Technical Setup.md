## Creating n8n Data Tables

![n8n Data Tables](https://articles.emp0.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/product-hunt-scraper-n8n-datatables.png)

The workflow uses n8n Data Tables to store configuration and runtime data.

### Step 1: Create a New Data Table

1. In your n8n instance, click **"Data Tables"** in the left sidebar
2. Click **"+ New Data Table"**
3. Name it: `product hunt` (or any name you prefer)
4. Set columns:
   - **Column 1**: `key` (type: String)
   - **Column 2**: `value` (type: String)

### Step 2: Note Your Data Table ID

1. After creating the table, open it
2. Copy the **Data Table ID** from the URL
   - Example: `https://app.n8n.cloud/projects/LAHZc7FnP0ywn2o3/datatables/3mOJkgv9zEcXiZP3`
   - The ID is: `3mOJkgv9zEcXiZP3`
3. **Save this ID** - you'll need it when configuring the workflow

### What This Table Stores

The Data Table keeps track of:
- `IS_WEBHOOK_CREATED`: Whether the Apify webhook has been registered (prevents duplicates)
- `RUNS`: JSON object tracking Apify actor run statuses
- `SHEET`: Google Sheets ID for storing leads

---

## Apify Configuration

Apify powers the scraping functionality. You'll need two actors:

### Step 1: Create an Apify Account

1. Visit [apify.com](https://www.apify.com/?fpr=99h7ds)
2. Sign up for a free account and use referral code: **99h7ds**
3. You get **$5 free credits** monthly (covers ~10 days of usage)
4. For production, upgrade to a paid plan

### Step 2: Subscribe to Required Actors

#### Actor 1: Advanced Product Hunt Scraper

1. Visit: [Advanced Product Hunt Scraper](https://www.apify.com/danpoletaev/product-hunt-scraper?fpr=99h7ds)
2. Click **"Try for free"** or **"Subscribe"**
3. Note the **Actor ID**: `danpoletaev/product-hunt-scraper`
4. This actor costs **$15/month rental** + compute costs

**What it does**: Scrapes Product Hunt for top products, including maker info, descriptions, upvotes, and social links.

#### Actor 2: Contact Info Scraper

1. Visit: [Contact Info Scraper](https://www.apify.com/vdrmota/contact-info-scraper?fpr=99h7ds)
2. Click **"Try for free"** or **"Subscribe"**
3. Note the **Actor ID**: `vdrmota/contact-info-scraper`
4. This actor is **pay-per-use** (no monthly rental)

**What it does**: Extracts emails, phone numbers, and social media profiles from product websites.

### Step 3: Get Your Apify API Token

1. In Apify, click your profile icon → **Settings**
2. Navigate to **Integrations**
3. Find **API Tokens** section
4. Click **"Create new token"**
5. Name it: `n8n-product-hunt-scraper`
6. Copy the token (starts with `apify_api_...`)
7. **Store this securely** - you'll add it to the workflow configuration

### Step 4: Configure Apify API Token in n8n Workflow

**Important**: After importing the workflow to your n8n instance, you need to configure the Apify API token as a Bearer token in the HTTP Request nodes.

1. In the workflow, locate all **HTTP Request** nodes that connect to Apify:
   - `Create External Webhook2`
   - `Run Actor "Daily Top Products"2`
   - `Run Actor "Weekly Top Products"2`
   - `Fetch Dataset Items2`

2. For each HTTP Request node:
   - Double-click to open the node
   - Scroll to **Authentication** section
   - Select **"Predefined Credential Type"** → **"Header Auth"**
   - Click **"+ Add Credential"** for Header Auth
   - Configure the credential:
     - **Name**: `Apify Bearer Token`
     - **Header Name**: `Authorization`
     - **Header Value**: `Bearer YOUR_APIFY_API_TOKEN` (replace with your actual token)
   - Click **"Save"**

3. Select this credential in all Apify HTTP Request nodes

**Why Bearer Token?**: This method provides better security and follows Apify's recommended authentication approach for API calls.

---

## Google API Setup

**Good news!** The workflow automatically creates a Google Sheet for you and stores its ID in the Data Table. You don't need to manually create a spreadsheet.

### Step 1: Enable Required Google APIs

Before configuring OAuth credentials in n8n, you **must enable** the following Google APIs in your Google Cloud Console:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Navigate to **"APIs & Services"** → **"Library"**
4. Enable the following APIs:
   - **Google Sheets API** - For creating and updating spreadsheets
   - **Google Drive API** - For file access and permissions
   - **Gmail API** - For sending outreach emails

5. For each API:
   - Search for the API name (e.g., "Google Sheets API")
   - Click on it
   - Click **"Enable"**
   - Wait for activation (usually instant)

**Important**: If these APIs are not enabled, the OAuth flow will fail or you'll get permission errors when the workflow runs.

### Step 2: Configure Google Sheets Authentication in n8n

#### OAuth2 (Recommended)

1. In n8n, go to **Credentials**
2. Click **"+ Add Credential"**
3. Search for **"Google Sheets"** and select **"Google Sheets OAuth2 API"**
4. Click **"Connect my account"**
5. Follow the Google OAuth flow
6. **Grant all requested permissions** for Sheets and Drive access
7. Name the credential: `Google Sheets`
8. Click **"Save"**

**Note**: When the workflow runs, it will automatically create a Google Sheet and store the ID in the Data Table. No manual sheet creation needed!

---

## Configure the Build Config Node

The **Build Config2** node is the central configuration hub.

1. Double-click the **"Build Config2"** node
2. Locate the JavaScript code
3. Update the following values:

```javascript
let config = {
  // ... existing config ...

  dataTableId: "YOUR_DATA_TABLE_ID",  // Replace with your Data Table ID (e.g., "3mOJkgv9zEcXiZP3")

  // ... more config ...

  externalScraper: {
    baseUrl: "https://api.apify.com/v2",
    payload: {
      webhook: {
        requestUrl: "https://YOUR_N8N_DOMAIN/webhook/product-hunt-scraper-workflow",
        // ↑ Replace with your n8n webhook URL (note the updated endpoint name)
      }
    }
  },

  // Note: apiBaseUrl has been removed in the latest version

  email: {
    fromEmail: "your-email@yourdomain.com",  // Your Gmail address for sending
    visitEmail: "https://yourwebsite.com",
    privacyPolicyUrl: "https://yourwebsite.com/privacy",
    termsOfServiceUrl: "https://yourwebsite.com/terms",
    ourWebsite: "Your Company Name"
  },

  day: {
    filter: {
      topNProducts: 50  // Daily scrape: 50 products (3 is just for testing)
    }
  },

  week: {
    filter: {
      topNProducts: 100  // Weekly scrape: 100 products
    }
  }
};
```

**Important Fields to Update:**

- **`dataTableId`**: Your Data Table ID from earlier (the workflow uses a new data table structure)
- **`requestUrl`**: Your n8n webhook URL - note the endpoint is `/product-hunt-scraper-workflow`
- **`fromEmail`**: Your Gmail address for sending (must match your Gmail API credentials)
- **`day.filter.topNProducts`**: Daily scraping set to **50 products** (the default of 3 is just for testing to avoid costs)
- **`week.filter.topNProducts`**: Weekly scraping set to **100 products**
- **Email branding fields**: Update URLs and company name
- **Note**: The `apiBaseUrl` field has been removed in the latest version

### Step 4: Find Your Webhook URL

1. In the workflow, locate the **"Receive Apify Webhook2"** node
2. Double-click to open it
3. The webhook path is: `/product-hunt-scraper-workflow` (updated from previous versions)
4. Your full webhook URL format:
   - **n8n Cloud**: `https://your-instance.app.n8n.cloud/webhook/product-hunt-scraper-workflow`
   - **Self-hosted**: `https://your-domain.com/webhook/product-hunt-scraper-workflow`

5. **Activate the workflow** (toggle in top-right corner) to enable the webhook

### Step 5: Update Webhook URL in Config

1. Copy your full webhook URL
2. Return to **"Build Config2"** node
3. Update the `requestUrl` field with your webhook URL
4. Click **"Save"**

### Step 6: Configure Credentials Throughout Workflow

The workflow has multiple nodes requiring credentials:

1. **Apify HTTP Request nodes** (4 nodes) - use Bearer token authentication as configured earlier:
   - `Create External Webhook2`
   - `Run Actor "Daily Top Products"2`
   - `Run Actor "Weekly Top Products"2`
   - `Fetch Dataset Items2`

   Ensure each has the Header Auth credential with `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_APIFY_TOKEN`

2. **Google Sheets nodes** (2 nodes):
   - `Import To Google Sheets2`
   - (Any other Sheets node)

   For each: Open node → Select your **Google Sheets OAuth2** credential

3. **Gmail node**:
   - `Send a message` (previously named "Send email1")
   - Configure Gmail OAuth2 credentials (already set up in Google API Setup section)

### Email Sending Limits & Account Bans

**Critical**: Sending too many emails can result in account suspension, even with Gmail API.

![Email Account Banned Warning](https://articles.emp0.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/product-hunt-scraper-email-banned.png)

**WARNING**: The image above shows what happens when you send emails too aggressively without proper precautions. Your account can be suspended or permanently banned.

#### Gmail API Limits
- **500 emails/day** (personal Gmail accounts)
- **2,000 emails/day** (Google Workspace accounts)
- **Sending to spam traps** → account flagged or banned
- **High bounce rates** (>5%) → deliverability issues
- **Spam complaints** → account suspension or restrictions

**Why This Happens:**
- Sending too many emails too quickly (cold start without warm-up)
- High bounce rates from invalid email addresses (no email verification)
- Spam complaints from recipients
- Sending to spam traps or honeypots
- Poor email content triggering spam filters

**Best Practices:**
- **Start with 10-20 emails/day** for the first week (critical warm-up period)
- **Gradually increase** to 100-200/day for personal Gmail, 500-1000/day for Workspace
- **Use email verification** (ZeroBounce) to reduce bounces and protect sender reputation
- **Include clear unsubscribe link** in every email
- **Monitor metrics daily**: bounce rates, spam complaints, delivery rates
- **Personalize every email** - avoid generic templates
- **Space out sending** throughout the day using batch settings
- **Never send to purchased lists** - only to publicly available Product Hunt contacts

#### General Email Safety
- **Never send unsolicited bulk email** without consent
- **Always include an unsubscribe mechanism**
- **Follow CAN-SPAM Act** (US) and GDPR (EU) regulations
- **Monitor your sender reputation** (use tools like mail-tester.com)
- **Warm up new domains slowly** (increase volume gradually over 2-4 weeks)

### Ethical Scraping Guidelines

- **Respect robots.txt** files
- **Don't overwhelm servers** with rapid requests
- **Product Hunt Terms of Service**: Review before commercial use
- **Personal data handling**: Follow GDPR and local privacy laws
- **Use data responsibly**: Don't resell or misuse contact information

### API Rate Limits

- **Apify**: Generally no hard limits, but costs scale with usage
- **Google Sheets**: 500 requests/100 seconds/user
- **Gmail API**: 1 billion quota units/day (sending = 100 units/email)

### Data Accuracy Disclaimer

- Contact info may be **outdated or incorrect**
- Not all products have **public contact details**
- Email accuracy typically **70-85%** (use verification)
- **Always verify critical information** before important outreach
